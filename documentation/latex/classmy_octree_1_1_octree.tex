\subsection{Detailed Description}
Class to store octree datastructure as nodes of the tree. 

Objects of this class are nodes of the tree. When a new object is created, children are assigned, parent is assigned, data block is assigned and finally the pointer of the object is pushed into the \char`\"{}nodes\char`\"{} list.

Usage\+: \hyperlink{classmy_octree_1_1_octree}{Octree} object\+\_\+name(x min, x max, y min, y max, z min, z max, level); This creates a node of the tree at the specified level. This object can be further refined or coarsened using member functions of this class.
